Hello, my name is Xavier but you can just call me X. I am from Brooklyn, New York and my family is also originally from New York aswell. I just graduated from MESA Charter High School and without really knowing what I wanted to do out of high school, I choose to go to Marcy Lab because I have been interested in Tech and using Tech mostly my whole life, so I felt that this was the best oppurtunity for me. My whole life I also played basketball and I am into video games. I played basketball during my high school year and I didn't do that good, but I still have passion and love for the game.
